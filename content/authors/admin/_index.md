I’m a jurist taking a Master’s degree in Administrative Law and Public Administration. Currently, most of my time is spent writing my dissertation, which is about the interplay between public bodies and authorities and artificial intelligence. Several rights and guarantees have been proposed in the light of technological change in this field, but it remains an underdeveloped subject. For example, both the GDPR and national and EU laws and guidelines on transparency have been perceived as offering a solution to the “black box” effect of AI. In my dissertation I propose that, while transparency plays a very relevant role as part of the solution, the obligations that emerge for public bodies need to be deepened and begin with the decision to adopt such technologies, and continue during the design phase. Merely disclosing the source code - when such possibility is legally tolerated - and allowing for a posteriori control and audits can be nearly impossible when AI is employed and, even when it is possible, it is of little use for the common citizen who whishes to scrutinize public decision-making.

Putting these two fields of study together has set me on the path to learn more about programming, and I’m just getting started. My website will be a little portfolio of my academic research and my passion for photography, whilst also serving as a fun tool to continue to learn programming. Stay posted!
